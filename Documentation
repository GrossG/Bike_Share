Saved down folder Bike_Share_Case_Study within my OneDrive
Created subfolder Originals, where I saved the original Excel files from the index bucket of divvy-tripdata

Created new Excel Workbooks outside of the subfolder but within the Bike_Share_Case_Study folder.
Added rows â€œride_length" and "day_of_week" to each file
